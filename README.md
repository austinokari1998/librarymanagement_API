## framework
Spring_Boot java
## project Description
The librarymanagement_API perfoms the normal operations that happen in any library system

It is mainly based on library users and the books as primary entities for JPA data persistence in a database of users choice(_though H2-embedded in-memory database was used for testing purposes_)

The endpoints here perform CRUD operations on the users and books, users can borrow, return and donate books.
